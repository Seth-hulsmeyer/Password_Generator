# Password_Generator

This webpage was designed to generate a random password which fits the criteria based on the user's choices.

The program will first ask the user their desired length of the password between 8 and 128 characters long. - If the user types in an integer outside of that range, and error will be altered to the user to enter in a number within that range. - If the user click cancel, the same error will pop-up

The program will then ask if the user wants lowercase and uppercase characters, numbers, and special characters.

Based on all of the prompted password length and confirmed variable criteria, the program will then create the randomly generated password, and display it on the html document page.
